# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of OpenKernel with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in OpenKernel, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@openkernel.ai
2. **Subject**: Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
3. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information (see below)
4. **Details**: Include as much information as possible

### What to Include

Please provide the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, CUDA version
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline for fix
- **30 days**: Security patch release (for high/critical issues)

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration
- Complete system compromise

#### High
- Local code execution
- Significant data exposure
- Authentication bypass
- Denial of service (persistent)

#### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (if applicable)
- Denial of service (temporary)
- Input validation issues

#### Low
- Minor information leaks
- Configuration issues
- Non-exploitable bugs

## Security Measures

### Development Security

- **Code Review**: All code changes require review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans with Safety
- **Container Scanning**: Docker images scanned with Trivy
- **Secrets Detection**: Pre-commit hooks prevent secret commits

### Runtime Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Sandboxing**: CUDA kernels run in isolated contexts
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and compute limits enforced
- **Logging**: Security events are logged and monitored

### Infrastructure Security

- **Encrypted Storage**: All data encrypted at rest
- **Secure Communications**: TLS 1.3 for all network traffic
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
3. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper user access controls
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding practices
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs thoroughly
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
4. **Logging**: Log security events appropriately
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in test suites

## Known Security Considerations

### CUDA Kernel Execution

- **Code Injection**: Generated CUDA code is validated before compilation
- **Memory Safety**: Bounds checking in generated kernels
- **Resource Limits**: GPU memory and compute limits enforced

### Distributed Training

- **Network Security**: Encrypted communication between nodes
- **Authentication**: Secure node authentication and authorization
- **Data Privacy**: Model weights and gradients are protected

### Data Pipeline

- **Input Validation**: All data sources are validated
- **Sanitization**: Web crawling includes content sanitization
- **Access Control**: Secure access to data sources

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure principles:

1. **Private Report**: Initial report made privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop fixes
3. **Coordination**: We coordinate with reporter on disclosure timeline
4. **Public Disclosure**: Details published after fix is available

### Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1**: Acknowledgment sent
- **Day 3**: Initial assessment completed
- **Day 7**: Detailed response with timeline
- **Day 30**: Target fix release (may vary by severity)
- **Day 37**: Public disclosure (7 days after fix)

### Recognition

We recognize security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly:

- **Security Advisory**: Credit in security advisory
- **Hall of Fame**: Recognition in security hall of fame
- **Swag**: OpenKernel security researcher merchandise
